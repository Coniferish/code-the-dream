## About

This application provides context for readers of "Arctic Dreams" by displaying weather patterns around the years* when Barry Lopez traveled through the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic, alongside current weather data for the same regions.

*Note: I have not read this book and was unable to find the exact years that his book spans, so a best guess was made.
